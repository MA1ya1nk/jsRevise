learn about array is ,or and from


        OBJECTS
object literals

const jsUser = {
   name: "Hitesh",
   age: 21,
   lastLogin: ["monday","tuesday"]
}
   why [] notation is necessary
   let you define a var   "full name": "mayank kumar" in object so you cant target it by jsUser.full name but jsUser["full name"]

   special case for symbols
